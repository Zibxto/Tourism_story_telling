# TOURISM STORY TELLING APPLICATION

This tourism story telling application has two parts: the client side and the server side.

The landing page of the client side contains story categories under which published and approved stories will be made available for story seekers consumption.

Before a user (Story teller) can become a member, he/she must first register via the registration page. Once registered, he/she has access to the dashboard where stories can be created and sent for approval (by the administrator) through a user friendly experience.

There are options for a user (story teller) to edit already published stories, manage profile and edit password.

The admin can manage members and member details by either editing or deleting through a user friendly process.

Admin can also manage published stories by story tellers either by editing story content except image, publishing story to public and hiding story from public.

**Note:** before a story can be viewed by the public, the admin must approve that story by clicking on the button with a value of view beside the story. After going through details of the story, the admin can click the publish to public button beneath the story.
